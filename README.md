## About me

I am a Mexican Software Developer and Mathematician :rocket:. My main role is Solution Architect and I love Python, Docker, SQL, Starlette, and AWS :snake:. I know other technologies such as LangGraph and LangSmith for AI implementations. :dolphin:. 

I think that a good programmer must have soft skills such as comunication and teamwork as well as good programming logic and abstraction.
